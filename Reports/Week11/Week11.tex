  \section{Questions}
    
    The Fresnel equations for computing the reflectance of the class were implemented during third week as the group
    thought it was needed at that point, so there was no difference from before about that. At this point, however, the
    project is able to render coloured translucent materials, as it is possible to change both the colour and the IOR of
    the material.
